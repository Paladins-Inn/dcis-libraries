## Abstract

These are the java libraries used to provide the client side functions of the different systems.


## License

The license for the software is LGPL 3.0 or newer.

The UI is an adoption of the [Start Bootstrap](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-sb-admin) theme which is MIT licensed.


## Architecture

tl;dr (ok, only the bullshit bingo words):

* Immutable Objects
* Relying heavily on generated code
* 100 % test coverage of human generated code
* Every line of code not written is bug free!

Code test coverage for human generated code should be 100%, machine generated code is considered bugfree until proven wrong.
But every line that needs not be written is a bug free line without need to test it. So aim for not writing code.


## A note from the author

If someone is interested in getting it faster, we may team up.
I'm open for that.
But be warned: I want to do it _right_.
So no short cuts to get faster.
And be prepared for some basic discussions about the architecture or software design :-).
